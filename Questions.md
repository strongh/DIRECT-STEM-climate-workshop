Datasets
=======

+ CMIP5 (which parts?)
   + TAS (surface air temperature)
   + PR? (precipitation - precipitation flux)
   + areacella (area of grid cells)
+ Other datasets for SW USA?
   + [Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) Project](http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/city-list/) - location specific temperature reanalysis designed to eliminate temperature biases, such as in IPCC
   + [PRISM High-Resolution Spatial Climate Data](http://prism.oregonstate.edu/) 

Possible themes
====

+ el nino [(it's important)](http://nautil.us/blog/el-nio-has-ended-kingdoms-and-civilizations)
+ comparing future climate scenarios
+ global temperatures (how feasible is 2°C? -- Paris COP21)
   + compare historical CMIP5 versus reanalysis data sets
   + HadCRUT4 temperature spiral [Ed Hawkins](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/files/2016/05/spiral_optimized.gif)
   + RCP scenarios (is <8.5 feasible?)
+ how does the Southwest CONUS fair in these RCP scenarios
   + What are the trends already in the historical? 
      + Maybe look at precip? (not really drying)
