"The possible futures of artic sea ice"

Broad questions
=======
+ when will the first Arctic-sea-ice-free summer be?
      + compare across possible scenarios
+ which areas are most sensitive/robust to climate changes?
      + compare across possible scenarios
+ which climate scenarios are most alarming?
      + are there "clusters" of scenarios which result in "similar" retreat of Arctic sea ice?
+ examine a component of the [Arctic amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_amplification) feedback system.
+ what is/are the relationships between Arctic sea ice and snow cover/cloud cover/SST
+ what is the relationship between Artic sea ice and salinity?
+ how will the regional Arctic climate change compared to global climate?
      + compare across possible scenarios

Datasets
=======

+ CMIP5 (mostly limited geographically to Arctic circle) (TODO be more specific about which variables are necessary)
   + TAS (surface air temperature)
   + SST
   + precipitation
   + cloud cover?
   + salinity?
   + other variables related to "Arctic amplification"?
