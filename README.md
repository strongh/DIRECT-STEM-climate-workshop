# DIRECT-STEM climate workshop
Materials for the DIRECT-STEM climate workshop at UCI

## Instructions

1.  If you haven't do so already, download and **install the [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution version 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)**.  If it offers to make itself your default Python distribution, allow it.
2. Whether you've just installed Anaconda, or you have done so previously, you should now **update Anaconda** to the latest version of the distribution.  It changes a lot so do this today even if you did recently.
 1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
 2. Type ```conda update conda``` and press enter or return.  Confirm that you'd like it to make any changes that it offers.
 3. Type ```conda update anaconda``` and press enter or return.  Confirm that you'd like it to make any changes that it offers.
3. **Download the code repository**.  
 1. [Download](https://github.com/strongh/DIRECT-STEM-climate-workshop/archive/master.zip) to download a zip file containing this entire repository.
 2. Unzip that file into a directory you know how to find; you'll need it several times throughout the day.
4. **Start a Jupyter notebook server**.
 1. Open a terminal and type ```jupyter notebook```.  Navigate to the directory where you unzipped this repository.
 2. Open "Test Notebook.ipynb".
 3. Click "Cell" at the top of the opened notebook, followed by "Run All" and ensure that 1) there are no errors and that 2) the output from the first cell is the same as that in the second.  If it doesn't match, raise your hand.
 4. If everything looks good, close the browser tab containing the test notebook but keep open the tab listing all the other notebooks.
